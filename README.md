# Hi, I'm Ibrahim! 

## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh. My research interests are in numerical solutions for partial differential equations (PDEs), mixed finite element methods, and computational fluid dynamics. With a background in both teaching and research, I enjoy finding ways to apply mathematical models to practical problems.
